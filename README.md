# League-of-Legends-Analysis
This is a data analysis project of League of Legends game matching on Korea Server 2020. The target is to analyze the win rates and popularity of each champion including their changes. After we understand which champions are strong and which champions are weak, I will proceed to find what resources or key points in the game matches affect the results. Via logistic regression, we can make a simple prediction on the game results and have a look at what the key points are.
The raw data is from Kaggle by [Minyong Shin](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gyejr95/league-of-legendslol-ranked-games-2020-ver1).
